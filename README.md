## 🎯 Project Summary

**Predicting customer subscription to term deposits using bank marketing data.**

This project leverages real-world structured data from a bank marketing campaign to build a predictive model that determines whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on their personal and interaction data. All required analytics tasks have been performed and visualized through interactive dashboards.

## 🚀 Project Stages Overview

### ✅ Part 1: Dataset & Project Setup
- Sector: **Banking / Marketing**
- Dataset: [Bank Marketing (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)
- Public, structured, and suitable for classification

### ✅ Part 2: Python Analysis
- Replaced missing/unknown values
- Removed invalid/zero rows
- Encoded categorical variables
- Visualized key patterns (target, job, education, duration)
- Trained **Logistic Regression model** (Accuracy ~84%)

### ✅ Part 3: Power BI Dashboard
- Imported final cleaned dataset
- Visualized subscription rate by:
  - Job
  - Education
  - Duration
  - Marital status
  - Month
- Slicers: Month, Job, Marital Status, Subscription
- Added pie charts, bar charts, histograms, and filters

## 📈 Sample Visuals (From Power BI)

> 👇 Screenshots are in `/screenshots` folder

| Visualization                  | Insight                                |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 📊 Job vs Subscription         | Management and retired people subscribe more |
| 📅 Month vs Subscription       | May and June have highest calls        |
| ⏳ Call Duration Distribution  | Longer calls tend to lead to subscription |
| 🎯 Target Distribution         | Majority did **not** subscribe (class imbalance)

---

## 🌍 Applications & Value

This project shows how marketing departments in banks can:

- 🎯 Target the right customers for term deposits  
- 🧩 Understand how job and education affect subscription  
- ⏳ Optimize campaign duration and call strategies  
- 📊 Use data to increase return on investment (ROI)
